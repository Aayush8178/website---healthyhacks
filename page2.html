        <P class="p3" style="text-align: center;"> Grabbing a quick snack on your way to work is the new breakfast trend. Also, healthy home-made meals are replaced by easily available foods from your favourite fast-food joints. Kids these days prefer these foods and tend to fulfil their nutrition requirement. While it may be only satisfying for the tongue, there is very negligible nutrition value in these junk foods.
        </P><br><br>
        <p class="p4" style="margin-top:1cm;text-align: center;">With our busy lives, we often resort to eating junk foods, but regular consumption can harm the body to the point of some irreparable damages. More evidently termed as fattening foods, but apart from those few inches on your waist, there are some serious effects of junk food.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>Let us look at a few harmful effects of junk food that take a toll on your body as well as brain:</p>

        <br><br>

        <p class="lastpara">
            Masturbation is harmless. Some people can experience tender skin if they are too rough,
            but this will heal in a few days. If men masturbate daily within short space of time, they might experience swelling of the penis which is called edema.
            The swelling will disappears within a couple of days.<br>Other side effects includes: <br><br>
            <b>Guilt:</b><br>
            Some people who worry that masturbation will conflict with their spiritual or religious
            beliefs can experience the feeling of guilt. Masturbation is not wrong or immoral and self-pleasure is no harm.
            If you discuss the feelings of guilt with your partner or with the sex specialist, c
            an help the person to move past the feelings of guilt which they connect with masturbation. <br><br>
            <b>Sexual sensitivity is decreased</b><br>
            If men do aggressive masturbation which involves a tight grip on their penis, they will experience decreased sensation. A man resolves this problem with a change in technique. Enhanced stimulation can help such as by using a vibrator, which will increase arousal in both men and women. Women
            who use a vibrator have shown improvement in sexual function while men experienced an improvement in erectile function.
            <br><br>
            <b>Prostate cancer:</b><br>
            It still is a debate about whether masturbation increases or decreases the risk of your prostate cancer. According to a study in 2003 men who ejaculated more than five times each week and are in their 20s were less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer than those who ejaculated less. Researchers
            have also found that men who ejaculated 20 times per month or more had a reduced risk of getting prostate cancer.
            <br><br>
            <b>Affecting daily life:</b><br>
            In some cases, some individuals can masturbate more than they desire, which can cause: <br><br>
            <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
                <li>Miss their work or important events</li>
                <li>Obstruct a personâ€™s daily functioning</li>
                <li>Affect their relationships</li>
                <li>It serves as an escape from the reality
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p class="endc">
                If you think that you might be impacted by masturbation practice, then you might speak with a healthcare professional.
                The doctor might suggest talk therapy to determine some ways by which they can handle their sexual behavior
